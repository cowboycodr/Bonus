# Bonus 
Bonus, a pure python GUI library wrapped around tkinter in development. The goal for Bonus is for it to be capable of making a variety of projects (Applications, Games, etc.) that run smoothly and look good, without the developer having to recreate the wheel.

## Goal
Currently my main goal is to get a smooth running chromium canvas rendering inside of a tkinter frame. This is not going to be the only option to make GUIs. But will be an easy way to make a GUI powered by python. 

## Status
The current status of Bonus UI, is it is able to make a window using an inherited class that provides plenty of features to the developer using the module. Hopefully I will be able to get the chromium canvas up and running within the next couple days to weeks.
