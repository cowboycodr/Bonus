# Bonus 
Bonus, a pure python GUI library wrapped around tkinter in development. The goal for Bonus is for it to be capable of making a variety of projects (Applications, Games, etc.) that run smoothly and look good, without the developer having to recreate the wheel.

##Status
Currently my main goal is to get a smooth running chromium canvas rendering inside of a tkinter frame. This is not going to be the only option to make GUIs. But will be an easy way to make a GUI powered by python.
